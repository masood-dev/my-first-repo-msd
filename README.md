# my-first-repo.msd
this is my first repo,
here i learn and practice github, python, C and visual code and many more.
i belive that hands on practice is required for effective learning, rather than just watching tutorials and learning without a structure.
so here i test, fail, learn and repeat.
```simplicity is real genius and it comes from messing up things a lot```
